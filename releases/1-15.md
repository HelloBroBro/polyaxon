## v1.15.0

> This minor release is a WIP.

### CLI
 
 * **Enhancement**: Collect `hash` information for uploaded artifacts in the lineage metadata. 
 
### Sidecar

 * **Enhancement**: Improve the artifacts syncing logic to be more resilient to failed requests or intermittent errors.

### Core
 
 * **Enhancement**: Add mid-runtime update with `apply` logic.

### Commercial

 * **New**: Add global search (cmd + k), a single global search field to provide easy access to:
   * Projects
   * Models
   * Components
   * Connections
   * Operations
 * **New**: Add notification center to allow users to control and manage notifications using the UI.
 * **New**: Add selection reports, this is similar to selection in v0 but the new implementation will support all the new features and dashboard flexibility (events, artifacts, lineages, comparison, custom columns selection, multi-field sorting, ...):
   * Allows adding single runs to a report from the run's overview page.
   * Allows adding multiple runs to a report using a multi-run action.
   * Add project sidebar button `Reports`.
   * Allow running downstream-ops for a report, e.g. multi-run Tensorboard.
 * **Enhancement**: Allow owner/billing users to reset the billing anchor date, several users asked to change when they get billed during month.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve UI to support redirection to the original page after authentication.
 * **Enhancement**: Add possibility to save searches on the global runs table.
 * **Enhancement**: Add possibility to save custom analytics searches.
 * **Enhancement**: Add more informative messages and handling when scaling down usage/agents/seats or when downgrading to a plan missing a specific feature.
 * **Enhancement**: Add support for resuming pipelines and matrix operations.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve resuming or restarting an operation that is part of a pipeline.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve Tags API and UI.
 * **Enhancement**: Investigate the new `suspend` feature to provide immediate concurrency change instead of the current [draining logic](/faq/How-does-changing-concurrency-work/).
 * **Fix**: Regression in metric early stopping policies.
