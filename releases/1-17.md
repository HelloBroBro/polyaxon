 * **Enhancement**: Extend artifacts command with `-l-kind/--lineage-kind` to `polyaxon ops artifacts --lineage-kind image` to downland assets based on a lineage reference kind.
 * **Enhancement**: Extend artifacts command with `-f/--file` to `polyaxon ops artifacts -f path/to/file1 -f other/path/to/file2` to accept downloading multiple file paths at once.
 * **Enhancement**: Extend artifacts command with `-d/--dir` to `polyaxon ops artifacts -d path/to/dir1 -d other/path/to/dir2` to accept downloading multiple file paths at once.
