## V1.18.0

> **N.B.**: This minor version is WIP and not released yet.

### CLI

 * **Enhancement**: Collect `hash` information for uploaded artifacts in the lineage metadata.

### Core

 * **New**: Add support for annotations in the connections specification.
 * **Enhancement**: Migrate hyperparameter tuning and tracking modules to separate repos.

### Client

 * **New**: Add promote method to a model version or artifact version directly from the `RunClient`:
   * `RunClient.promote_to_model_version` this is similar to `ProjectClient.register_model_version` but directly from the run client instance.
   * `RunClient.promote_to_artifact_version` this is similar to `ProjectClient.register_artifact_version` but directly from the run client instance.
 * **New**: Add `get_artifacts_lineage` to `ProjetClient` to allow listing artifacts lineage information from multiple runs under the same project.

### Operator

 * **Enhancement**: Update training operator to use the newest Kubeflow release.

### Tracking

 * **New**: Allow to specify the connection name when logging assets and artifacts to associate the lineage to a specific connection. 
 * **Enhancement**: Improve logic around assets and artifacts logging to only trigger versioned behavior (step-wise) when a step parameter is provided.  

### Streams
  
 * **New**: Add support for multi-connections:
   * Possibility to mount multiple volumes to upload and download artifacts to and from connections other than the artifacts store.

### UI

 * **New**: Add operation status color indicator to the page's favicon.
 * **New**: Add markdown, scalar, summary, lineage, and performance widgets.
 * **New**: Add Metrics/Params correlation and importance.

### Hub

 * **New**: Add DVC(data version control) integration.
 * **New**: Add support for ssh connection to allow connecting VSCode and Pycharm.

### Docs

 * **Enhancement**: Fix documentation edit links. 

### Commercial

 * **New**: Add support for readme to component/model/artifact versions.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve operations in DAGs with pending approval and upstream failures.
 * **Enhancement**: Reduce member roles confusion:
   * Add a note to `admin` to specify that is a `Project admin`.
   * Add a note to `manager` to specify that is a `Organization admin`.
