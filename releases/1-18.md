## V1.18.0

> **N.B.**: This minor version is WIP and not released yet.

### CLI

 * **Enhancement**: Collect `hash` information for uploaded artifacts in the lineage metadata.

### Core

 * **New**: Add support for annotations in the connections specification.
 * **Enhancement**: Migrate hyperparameter tuning and tracking modules to separate repos.

### Client

 * **New**: Add promote method to a model version or artifact version directly from the `RunClient`:
   * `RunClient.promote_to_model_version` this is similar to `ProjectClient.register_model_version` but directly from the run client instance.
   * `RunClient.promote_to_artifact_version` this is similar to `ProjectClient.register_artifact_version` but directly from the run client instance.
 * **New**: Add `get_artifacts_lineage` to `ProjetClient` to allow listing artifacts lineage information from multiple runs under the same project.
 * **New**: Add new `OrganizationClient`, this client will only be accessible to users with enough permissions or it will raise 401/403 errors:
    * Allows listing and interacting with agents.
    * Allows listing and interacting with connections.
    * Allows listing projects.
    * Allows listing cross project runs.

### Operator

 * **Enhancement**: Update training operator to use the newest Kubeflow release.

### Query Language
 
 * **New**: Allow filtering by connections:
    * By name `connections.name: CONNECTION1 | CONNECTION2`
    * By tag `connections.tags: TAG1 | TAG2`
    * By kind `connections.kind: git`
 * **New**: Allow filtering by artifacts lineage:
    * By name `artifacts.name: LINEAGE1 | LINEAGE2`
    * By kind `artifacts.kind: model`
    * By path `artifacts.path: foo/bar`
    * By state `artifacts.state: STATE`

### Tracking

 * **New**: Allow to specify the connection name when logging assets and artifacts to associate the lineage to a specific connection.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve logic around assets and artifacts logging to only trigger versioned behavior (step-wise) when a step parameter is provided.
 * **Enhancement**: Add support for new pytorch-lightning versions and fix issue with [log_hyperparams](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/commit/115a5d08e8b868109a424af213bd7f23537654f1).

### Streams
  
 * **New**: Add support for multi-connections:
   * Possibility to mount multiple volumes to upload and download artifacts to and from connections other than the artifacts store.

### UI

 * **New**: Add operation status color indicator to the page's favicon.
 * **New**: Add markdown, scalar, summary, lineage, and performance widgets.
 * **New**: Add Metrics/Params correlation and importance.
 * **New**: Show an indicator on artifacts lineage if it's promoted to a model version or artifact version.
 * **New**: Add connection information to artifacts lineage.
 * **Enhancement**: Update the queues table with a link next to each queue to filter all runs by a specific queue.
 * **Enhancement**: Update the connections table with a link next to each connection to filter all runs by a specific connection.
 * **Enhancement**: Show artifact' state on the lineage tables.
 * **Fix**: Typo in tip for registering component/model/artifact versions.

### Hub

 * **New**: Add DVC(data version control) integration.
 * **New**: Add support for ssh connection to allow connecting VSCode and Pycharm.

### Docs

 * **Enhancement**: Fix documentation edit links.

### Deployment

 * **Security**: Fix security CVE issues.

### Commercial

 * **New**: Add support for readme on component/model/artifact versions.
 * **New**: Allow getting a connection's schema by name.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve operations in DAGs with pending approval and upstream failures.
 * **Enhancement**: Reduce member roles confusion:
   * Add a note to `admin` to emphasize that is a `Project admin`.
   * Add a note to `manager` to emphasize that is a `Organization admin`.
